<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Errol O'Brien<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc306294</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of the website is to increase the number of customers, particularly teenagers and young adults, at the costume store CossiePlay. The website should also help increase the number of people who attend the monthly CossiePlay cosplay party as well as assist in the sales of costumes through the online price list.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Success of the website will be determined by the increase in sales of costumes as well as the number of people attending the monthly costume parties. The website will be considered especially successful if a mojority of these new customers are young adult and teenagers as they are the target audience.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience of the website are teenagers and young adults who live in and around the Hulkstown area. In order to cater of them the website will be designed to work on smart phones (Android and IOS) on 3g as they are one of the main platforms younger people access the Internet with. With this in mind, the website will need to be small in file size so it does not take too long to load as 3g is not that fast. To aid this information on the website should be consise but informative. As well as the target audience, the website should also cater to the current demographic (35-50 year olds). To do this the website should be able to run on the most popular browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari), be astectically pleasing with bright colours and contain good formatting and web design.</p>
